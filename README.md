# ᓚᘏᗢ Pawsh ZSH Theme

Konnichiwa, terminal-tomodachi! Welcome to Pawsh, a super kawaii zsh theme for oh-my-zsh, inspired by Japanese neko (cat) culture. Your prompt becomes a cute cat face (`ᓚᘏᗢ`) that changes color, sugoi style, depending on your command's mood. Make your terminal more genki and stylish, ne!

## Features (Kawaii pointo!)

- Kawaii neko prompt: Cat face (`ᓚᘏᗢ`) turns green for happy (success) and red for sad (fail) commands. Cat-chan always watching your code, desu!
- Current directory always in cool cyan, so you never get lost, senpai.
- Git branch and status, totally sugoi for your code dojo.
- Color feedback for command status, like a real anime transformation!
- Minimalist and clean, but full of kawaii spirit.
